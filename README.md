# SpaceDebrisObservation
This repository implements the evolutive algorithm NSGA-II to solve the multiobjective problem "Space Debris Observation"

The "Space Debris Observation" is a scheduling problem where the observation a set objects with an observation window may me asigned to a set of telescopes.  

Two objetive functions were considered:
* Maximize the observation of objects with high scientific priority
* Minimize the antena's operational cost.
